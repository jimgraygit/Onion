Hello. Thank you so much to everyone for your work on Onion!!

If none of this is useful, I had fun and learned a lot about Onion regardless.

I also created and shared a custom installer, please let me know if that's not okay...

In the installer I rename and tweak some of the existing ports as well.

Thanks again ^_^
